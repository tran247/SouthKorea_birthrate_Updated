News outlets report that the birth rate is declining in high income countries, including South Korea. Some explanations for the cause may be linked to economic variables, such as high housing costs, low disposable income, lack of a college education, and debt. The purpose of our project is to create a SQL database that will contain the data points necessary to analyze how fertility rates in the country of South Korea are associated with multiple economic variables. 

Our final report can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bot-zN938uYuWS6cxrQQ5dXyXC8hZTenYi-OsfFZb5g/edit?usp=sharing
The final report is also included in this repo as a .docx file.
