# SouthKorea_birthrate_Updated

During the second group project for my Data Science/Analytics Boot Camp with Georgia Institute of Technology, my team and I wanted to use birthrate data along with social economical data to show why there is a decline in birthrates in South Korea.

This will be a stand alone project apart from my group as I will tailor this project to best showcase my abilities. 

Intro- 
News outlets report that the birth rate is declining in high income countries, including South Korea. Some explanations for the cause may be linked to economic variables, such as high housing costs, low disposable income, lack of a college education, and debt. The purpose of our project is to create a SQL database that will contain the data points necessary to analyze how fertility rates in the country of South Korea are associated with multiple economic variables.
